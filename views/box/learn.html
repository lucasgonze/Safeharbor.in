				<li class="question" id="Q1"><h4>What is copyright?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Copyright is a form of legal protection provided for original, tangible works.  It exists to ensure that the creator will be able to receive the financial benefits of their work.There are a bundle of exclusive rights granted by law to copyright owners for the protection of their original work, including the right to control the copying, distributing, displaying, performing, adapting and transmitting of their work. Uploading and sharing content on the internet may implicate a copyright owner’s exclusive rights. There are exceptions to copyright.  The nature of these exceptions depends on the national copyright law that applies.  In the USA, “fair use” is the most common exception. (For more information see definition of “fair use” below.)</p>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li>

				<li class="question" id="Q2"><h4>What are some examples of copyrighted works?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<ul>
						<li>Movies and movie previews</li>
						<li>Music videos</li>
						<li>Personal videos of live events</li>
						<li>Commercials</li>
						<li>TV shows</li>
						<li>Photographs (usually the photographer, not the subject of the photo, has the rights)</li>
					</ul>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 

		<hr />
				<li class="question" id="Q3"><h4>Am I  a copyright/holder copyright owner?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>A copyright holder or owner is a person or a company who owns any of the Exclusive Rights of copyright in a particular work. In the USA, if you create an original work, that  establishes you are the copyright owner - there is no legal requirement to register or declare copyright ownership.  If you are not absolutely sure you are the copyright owner, or their designated agent, you may want to consult an attorney.  <a href="http://copyright.gov">Copyright.gov</a> and <a href="http://chillingeffects.org">chillingeffects.org</a> may provide useful information.</p>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 

		<hr />
				<li class="question" id="Q4"><h4>Am I an authorized agent of the copyright owner?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>You know if you are an authorized agent because it is a legally established relationship. For example, you might be in-house counsel at a record label. If you are neither the copyright holder, nor their legally authorized agent,  and you have information on what you believe to be a copyrighted infringing work on our website, contact the copyright owner directly.  Do not use this form. You could face substantial financial and legal repercussions if you submit this form when unauthorized to do so. </p>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 

		<hr />
				<li class="question" id="Q5"><h4>I’ve heard the phrase “fair use” -  what does it mean?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>“Fair use” is a legal term with a specific meaning.  It does not mean “seems fair to me”.
					The doctrine of “fair use” has developed over time from decisions in court cases.
					Refer to <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/">http://www.copyright.gov/title17/</a> for details. Section 107  of the US Copyright Law contains a list of purposes for which the reproduction of a specific work may be considered fair, such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. Section 107 also outlines four factors to be considered in determining “fair use”:
					1 The purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is for commercial or nonprofit educational purposes;
					2. The nature of the copyrighted work, for instance, is it factual or creative;
					3. The amount and importance of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and;
					4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</p>

					<p>The line between what is “fair use” and what is infringement in a particular case is not always clear.  The factors are weighed and decided in court. There is no specific number of words, lines, or notes that may safely be used without permission. Acknowledging the source of the copyrighted material does not substitute for obtaining permission from the copyright owner. “Fair use” does not stop anyone from suing; it becomes an affirmative defense against an infringement suit.  The copyright holder may legitimately disagree that a given use is fair and may decide to have it decided in court. Some copyright owners make numerous claims of infringement, even in circumstances where the “fair use” defense would likely succeed in court, hoping that the user will refrain from use rather than spending money on a legal “fair use” defense because the defendant has the burden of proof.</p>

				<li class="question" id="Q6"><h4>How can I avoid copyright infringement?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Your safest course is to create something entirely original. It is not enough to give credit to the copyright owner/holder -  it may still be copyright infringement.If you must use something someone else created, get their permission to use their work. When it is impracticable to obtain permission from the copyright owner, you should consider avoiding the use of copyrighted material altogether, unless you are very confident the doctrine of “fair use” will apply and you can afford the legal expense to defend it.</p>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 
						<hr />

				<li class="question" id="Q7"><h4>What is copyright infringement?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>When a copyrighted work is copied, displayed in public, performed, or distributed without 
					permission from the copyright owner, it is called a copyright infringement.
Under Section 501 of the United States Copyright Act, someone  who violates any of the exclusive rights of a copyright owner is a copyright &#8220;infringer.&#8221; Uploading copyright infringing content can get you sued if the copyright owner decides to take legal action. Even if you give credit to the creator, it still may be copyright infringement.</p>

				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 

		<hr />
				<li class="question" id="Q9"><h4>What is the DMCA?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a U.S. law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World International Property Organization.  It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works. The DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet. The DMCA amended Title 17 of the  U.S. Code to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of providers of on-line services for copyright infringement by their users.</p>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 

		<hr />
				<li class="question" id="Q9-1"><h4>What is 17 USC § 512?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>"17 USC § 512" stands for "Title 17 of the  U.S. Code." It is the law that defines how to handle notifications of claimed copyright infringement. You can read it online at <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512">http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512</a>. "<a href="#Q9" class="underline">The DMCA</a>" and "17 USC § 512" are sometimes used as synonyms.</p>

		<hr />
				<li class="question" id="Q10"><h4>What are the “safe harbor” provisions for websites?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Section 512(d)  provides “safe harbors” that give website owners immunity from financial and legal liability for users&#8217; possible copyright infringement &#8212; IF the website expeditiously and thoroughly follows the DMCA’s procedures. To qualify for the safe harbor provision of the DMCA, a  web site must:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Notify its customers of its policies. </li>
						<li>Designate an agent who will receive copyright infringement communications from copyright owners or reporting organizations. </li>
						<li>Notify the Copyright Office of the agent’s name and contact information and make that information available on their website. </li>
						<li>Not have knowledge that the material or activity is infringing,zx or be aware of the fact that the infringing material exists on its website.</li>
					</ul>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 
				
						<hr />

				<li class="question" id="Q11"><h4>When am I protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s Safe Harbor rules?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Unfortunately, even when followed strictly,  courts of law have disagreed on how to apply the safe harbor protections.  </p>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 

		<hr />
		
				<li class="question" id="Q12"><h4>If  there’s a disclaimer on our website that states we do not support copyright infringement  - is that good enough to protect us? </h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>No, a disclaimer won’t protect you from liability if copyrighted works are being illegally copied and distributed.  It is better to adhere fully to the Safe Harbor provisions outlined in the DMCA.</p>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 

		<hr />
		
				<li class="question" id="Q13"><h4>What am I responsible for if I  run a website and visitors upload to my site?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>You need to follow the DMCA regulations closely.  There are potential substantial legal and financial consequences if you do not.</p>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 

		<hr />
			
				<li class="question" id="Q14"><h4>If I didn’t know I was doing something illegal, am I in the clear?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>No. Claiming ignorance cannot be used as a defense to direct copyright infringement.</p>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 
		<hr />
		
				<li class="question" id="Q15"><h4>What if the website is hosted in another country?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>International rules allow the U.S. to enforce its copyright rules under local laws in over 100 participating nations.</p>
				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 

		<hr />
				<li class="question" id="Q16"><h4>I run a website, how do I register an agent to comply with the DMCA Safe Harbor provision?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>An Interim Designation (for first time registering) or an Amended Designation (for changes)  form should be accompanied by the appropriate fee payable to the Register of Copyrights. The fee includes the ability to list only one name of the service provider, i.e., the service provider’s legal name. If additional, alternative names are filed with the Office, each group of 10 alternative names (or fewer) will require the payment of an additional fee, currently $30, in addition to the $105 basic filing fee. For example, if a service provider wants to list five alternative names by which the service provider is doing business (e.g., five website domains), the fee for the filing would be $135 ($105 for the basic designation plus $30 for the five alternative names). See the FAQ at <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/">http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/</a> for more examples. To designate an agent, you can use the <em>Interim Designation of Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (PDF format)</em> form at <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/agent.pdf">http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/agent.pdf</a>.</p>

					<p>Mail the form and fee to:</p>
					<pre>Copyright I&amp;R/Recordation
P.O. Box 71537

				</div><!-- end answer --></li> 

		<hr />
				<li class="question" id="Q17"><h4>I’ve already registered an agent and now I want to make a change or add another agent, what do I need to do?</h4>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Amended designations must be accompanied by the basic filing fee, and will replace the prior information. If the service provider wishes to list alternative names with the amended designation, the additional fee for each group of 10 or fewer names must be provided. Any additional names listed in an amended designation will replace, not supplement, the alternative names that will be associated with the service provider. In order to add additional names to the existing alternative names listed for a service provider, all of the alternative names should be listed cumulatively on an amended designation, and the appropriate fee should be calculated based on the total of all the alternative names listed.</p>

					<p>Definition: For purposes of section 512(c), a “service provider” is defined as a provider of online services or network access, or the operator of facilities therefor, including an entity offering the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user’s choosing, without modification to the content of the material as sent or received.</p>

					<p>To amend a previously filed “Designation of Agent” you can use the 
					<em>Amended Interim Designation of Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (PDF format)</em> form at <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/agenta.pdf">http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/agenta.pdf</a>.</p>
