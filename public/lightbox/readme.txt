This directory contains supporting resources to use a lightbox for the form for administrators to enter a new dispute.

We're using a library called Fancybox, which we got from http://fancybox.net/api .

The version of this library at the time we initially fetched it was 2.1.3-0. That original fetch is in this directory as fancyapps-fancyBox-v2.1.3-0-gcd2bc9a.zip. I'm keeping it intact verbatim so that we can compare our local version with the original, so that we can identify anything changed/patched in the original.
